mistake.,108,305,546531,Sometimes when we have a trouble- we said (like) God wanted it.,108,305,546532,Every person wrote --?,108,305,12246533,Many time.,108,305,7046534,the water go through our bone,108,305,7046535,Doctor said you have to exam.,108,305,7046536,One doctor did a surgery- and leave inside the person a pair of scissors.,108,305,12246537,She realized that have something

own skill.,108,305,6646549,I think this reason is more affect that doctor has confidence.,108,305,546550,Then he decided try to do surgeries which are more than his ability.,108,305,546552,I think it difficult to think difference between medical mistakes and accidents.,108,305,6646553,When patients is almost dying- if you're a doctor- you should take some action.,108,305,6646554,How do you

surgery--,108,305,10646563,You find a doctors who just graduated from the medical school.,108,305,546564,I think doctors who have worked for a long time thought that they would do a good

one week.,108,305,546569,Do you think they should made them pay- the family?,108,305,12246570,If they will say that the doctor don't want more--,108,305,10646573,We're going to start with the first group- who was--,108,306,546574,I think I don't have the right of talking about their experience.,108,306,12246575,Medical mistakes happens.,108,306,12246576,His wife was pregnant- and there were something wrong.,108,306,12246577,Second reason is there were too much self-reliance.,108,306,12246578,Is the price that you have to pay for getting individual freedom.,108,306,12246580,Everyone didn't understand it.,108,306,7046581,When doctor have worked for long time- he believe himself so much.,108,306,7046582,I have seen thousand like this sickness.,108,306,12246583,Make them take a rest is a way of avoid the medical mistake.,108,306,12246584,There are some mistake that may happen.,108,306,12246585,Is almost same with first group.,108,306,7046586,the causes of medical mistake,108,306,7046588,We talked about the punishment for doctors who have mistake.,108,306,7046589,I think depends on his mistake.,108,306,546590,The other person- who is absent today- talked that it is too much to take their license away.,108,306,7046591,It's same with forgetting to bring our materials to class.,108,306,7046592,Can I go to next step?,108,306,7046593,Somebody said there are too much works for doctors.,108,306,7046594,If you go to emergency room- the rooms are full of patients- and there are a small number of doctors.,108,306,7046595,She said doctors are too confident for their working.,108,306,7046596,When you meet doctors in clinic- the patients feel in very low position-and doctors in a high position.,108,306,7046597,Is there example of over self-confidence.,108,306,7046598,We knows this kind of tendency- when we visit the clinic.,108,306,7046599,Just eat this medicine!,108,306,7046600,And there were also Hend's case- too.,108,306,7046601,They did mistake.,108,306,546602,The mistake was they give him an extra dose- an extra medicine.,108,306,546603,After that- the doctors made conference for me and my husband.,108,306,546604,At that time- my son- his face changed for blue.,108,306,546605,I thought that's normal- because he was sick.,108,306,546606,Maybe the patient might be dead- whatever the doctors do.,108,306,7046607,He have (like) to do something.,108,306,546608,He might do the wrong decision.,108,306,546610,The doctor give him a medicine- but the pharmacy gave him a wrong

daughter.,108,306,546623,I thought how can I do.,108,306,10646624,It was very funny situation.,108,306,10646625,I was very luck- because the doctor accept that I could write about my health problem.,108,306,10646626,I didn't know how can I explain the problem.,108,306,546627,I asked to the doctor send me e-mail.,108,306,10646628,That's about if you want married give for your wife

their country.,108,709,565270,I think they are stuck in a room.,108,709,565271,They said we all think that leader of N.K. is stupid and trying to attack American.,108,709,15965272,They are making

from N.K.,108,709,15965277,Do you think guys N.K. is gonna attack?,108,709,12265278,I think he just wanna show he have power.,108,709,565279,Do you think that the USA is gonna react strongly?,108,709,12265280,They said N.K. missiles cannot attack on American.,108,709,15965281,Our defenses is better.,108,709,15965282,They are afraid is N.K. has missiles.,108,709,15965283,They were always in fight- right?,108,709,12265284,So S.K. is just involved because they near to them?,108,709,12265285,I was just wondering what to make him behave in this way?,108,709,565286,Are they sure because they own the power?,108,709,565287,So- this their action.,108,709,565288,I think we can go back before 50 years.,108,709,15965289,Imagine if China support N.K. what will happen.,108,709,12265290,They did like that.,108,709,15965291,It's a scary about that.,108,709,12265292,I don't think the situation is affect us like we will return to our country.,108,709,565293,I think it's just a talk.,108,709,565294,I think its time US talks with Michael Jordan.,108,709,12265295,Why he act like that?,108,709,565296,I'm very interesting about this topic.,108,709,15965297,It's his country policy.,108,709,565298,They have their own view to the world.,108,709,565299,His father was like him?,108,709,565300,Don't you think the other countries is gonna do something?,108,709,12265301,How do affect the environment?,108,709,12265302,I'm an engineer but I never research about that.,108,709,12265303,Why do some countries have the right to own but others not?,108,709,565304,Well it was supposed that Iran sign something.,108,709,12265305,In the Middle East we have just two countries.,108,709,565306,Why some countries allow to have?,108,709,565307,Absolute power is the only reason.,108,709,565308,I have- you don't have.,108,709,565309,We made the rules but someone just break it.,108,709,15965310,How was the phrase?,108,709,12265311,I research on the Google and I think it was Thomas Jefferson who said it.,108,709,12265312,To have an absolute power you should be an evil guy so you cannot have without being a bad guy.,108,709,565313,I think no.,108,709,565314,I think they can stop this troubles.,108,709,12265315,If you want to stop N.K.- you wil not stop just one country.,108,709,565316,They made like 50 people died.,108,709,15965317,Sued them from the global court.,108,709,15965318,It's good people and bad guy.,108,709,565319,The people why don't they say stop right now?,108,709,565320,Why they don't say that?,108,709,565321,They like 80% people there admire their leader.,108,709,15965322,They happy with that?,108,709,565323,They haven't seen outside world.,108,709,565324,So if the people don't want to do a revolution no one can do anything.,108,709,565325,Like Iraq- the situation it's worse.,108,709,565326,Tunisia and Egypt have army.,108,709,565327,We have like batallions- army for government only.,108,709,565328,The army Libya government destroyed completely.,108,709,565329,Not a necessary to follow the crowd.,108,709,565330,So why do they need to chain?,108,709,565331,They should sit in the table and talk with other country.,108,709,565332,What we have to lose?,108,709,565333,Why it's impossible?,108,709,565334,I think each problem has a solution either we know it or not.,108,709,565335,They are not accept to talk.,108,709,12265336,But that what they ask for.,108,709,565337,How could you please or know that the player represent the country for one reason but not another?,108,709,565338,I think that.,108,709,12265339,The concept of people obtaining power is different from person to another.,108,709,565340,There is some humans want power on another.,108,709,565341,I think it's a part of the human nature.,108,709,565342,Difference from area to area and people to people.,108,709,565343,For some people it starts become greed to have more power.,108,709,565344,But the absolute power I don't think it's intrinsic in human nature.,108,709,10665345,Otherwise we all be fighting each other.,108,709,10665346,Tehre is some exceptions.,108,709,10665347,I don't know if it's psychologic characteristic.,108,709,10665348,It's not common this megalomaniac characteristic.,108,709,10665349,I'm completing with you.,108,709,565350,For example- leader.,108,709,565351,The leader have specialist for how to organize people.,108,709,565352,Yeah but we can't take it for granted that all human.,108,709,565353,We cannot generalize that human don't want.,108,709,565354,Like any bad things in our life- it's bad thing.,108,709,565355,I think it depend in the human how he raised.,108,709,565356,The list of the presidents the list of who kills over 20 millions.,108,709,565357,There are a good leadership who has power.,108,709,565358,They can get benefit from the power.,108,709,565359,When he go to be like a king or president he go to organize the country.,108,709,565360,That's how a leader become a tyrant.,108,709,10665361,I think it's a characteristic for leaderhip to use in a negative way.,108,709,565362,They put a leader to organize them.,108,709,565363,He do the same work as the company for example.,108,709,565364,What about when we say about government?,108,709,565365,Government they've people from us.,108,709,565366,If there's nobody volunteering to do these things.,108,709,565367,I put example for a person who want improve his community.,108,709,565368,The person want the power.,108,709,565369,Like the Snowball in Animal Farm.,108,709,565370,We see the different between Napoleon and Snowball.,108,709,565371,We all need to have power about our lives.,108,709,10665372,Practicing more power- control may lead them to absolute power.,108,709,565373,There is also some leaders force people give him some powers.,108,709,565374,Inside they don't like him.,108,709,565375,So absolute power you take away someone right or something?,108,709,10665376,So it depends also the time- where it's happening.,108,709,10665377,We told that he's dictator.,108,709,565378,He has the absolute power- he's been president for so long a time.,108,709,565379,People always use it the bad side.,108,709,10665380,So maybe a dictator not always to be a tyrant.,108,709,565381,I think tyrant is more in the personality of the person.,108,709,565382,But if he get the power and be the leader and maybe years later he be the dictator.,108,709,565383,After his finish of leading his country maybe he become a normal person.,108,709,565384,If he got out from being president or king and nobody kill him- now he is okay.,108,709,565385,There is a lot of dictators.,108,709,565386,It was already a tyrant government.,108,709,10665387,Your mind is like sick or something like that.,108,709,12265388,The king have the absolute power.,108,709,565389,They cannot stop the king of doing something.,108,709,565390,He takes these power from the constitution.,108,709,565391,Sometimes the counsel they approve or agree to something- he just sign.,108,709,565392,Is a different.,108,709,12265393,He say I made a rules.,108,709,12265394,Yes- we have an examples.,108,709,565395,But outside this country- they said how?,108,709,565396,And this the second question.,108,709,12265397,you should tall comfortably,106,711,565398,try once

should add.,108,910,6675204,For example- a man killed one woman and he was stalker so he wanted to keep her away from other people.,108,910,6675205,So I think it's similar idea to hunters.,108,910,6675206,I want to explain they don't hate but they don't love.,108,910,6675207,So what do we think about hunting?,108,910,12275208,Is not a crime for you- okay?,108,910,12275209,So you don't think it should be banned.,108,910,12275210,Like the guns- selling ammunitions and the taxes.,108,910,12275211,And of course they are for

keep the species alive.,108,910,10675218,If you wanna call something as a crime- it should be banned on public- I mean.,108,910,7075219,Some animals are more important than others.,108,910,7075220,So it means controlling population of animals is important.,108,910,7075221,But when we talk about crime- it's a kind of rule-breaking.,108,910,7075222,So maybe the word crime is a little strong.,108,910,7075223,But logically thinking about it- maybe they just hunted some animals but they follow the rules.,108,910,7075224,After you bring back- what do you do?,108,910,6675225,So you shooting but you don't kill them.,108,910,6675226,It's kind of for me- it's still crime.,108,910,6675227,If you go to the hunting- the animal will survive.,108,910,6675228,I mean it's kind like ethical or unethical.,108,910,6675229,I'm a little bit angry American hunting culture.,108,910,6675230,The story broadcase TV but other African hunter
